Sentinel Controlled Loop

Difference between do-while and while: if you want loop to run at least once, use do-while, otherwise use while

for (initialAction; loop-continuation-condition; action-after-each-iteration;) {
	// Loop Body
}

for ( ; ; ) {					while (true) {
		      <=============>		
}						}
